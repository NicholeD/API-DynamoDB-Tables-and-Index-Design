We are planning to expand our service with the following operation:
1. `GetEventsForOrganizer`
   * Retrieve all `Event` data for a provided `organizerId`

1. Which table contains the data necessary for the operation?
   - ANSWER: DynamoDBIndexes-Events
2. Explain why we cannot use load or query on the base table to retrieve this data.
   - ANSWER: Tables only allow this with a single partition key
3. Design the GSI we would create for `GetEventsForOrganizer`.
   - What table would we create the GSI for?
      - ANSWER: Events
   -  What is the partition key of the GSI?
      - ANSWER: organizerId
   -  Does the GSI have a sort key? If so, what?
      - ANSWER: date
   -  What attributes from the base table need to be projected to the GSI?
      - ANSWER: organizerId, time, name, description, isCanceled
   -  What are the pros/cons of using INCLUDE vs ALL for the attribute projection in this case?
      - ANSWER: Include: we can exclude isCanceled. All: we'll be able to include isCanceled which is a
                feature we'll want in the future
   - Which will you use?
      - ANSWER: All - it's not that much more data than the bare minimum we would use for Include
